Running Example of the Astract Factory DP

An abstract factory provides an interface for creating families of related or 
dependant objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
In other words this design pattern allows us to create objects that follow a 
general pattern. 

In this example we'll create two implementations of the factory method design
pattern: AnimalFactory and ColorFactory. 
After that we will manage to access to them using an abstract factory called 
AbstractFactory
