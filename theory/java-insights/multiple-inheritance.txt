-- ON MULTIPLE INHERITANCE -- 

Java support multiple inheritance by supporting multiple implementations 
of interfaces: a class can implemenet more than one interface.

Hoewer a class cannot extend more than one class because it can lead to 
the diamond problem and rather than providing complex ways to solve it 
there are better ways to achieve multiple inheritance. 

- exmaple of diamond problem: 

                    class A
                   /       \
                  /         \
              class B     class C
                   \       /
                    \     /
                    class D

if class B and class C define the same method foo(). If an object of type D 
call super.D() which method is called?
