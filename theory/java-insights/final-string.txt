- Does it make sense to define a final String? -

The String object is immutable but the reference to that string can change. 

example: 
    String s = "hello" 

Now, "hello" can not be changed in memory but we can reassign the value held by the 
variable s, to make it reference a different string!
    s = "goodbye"

If we create the following
    final String s = "hello" 
then s cannot even be reassigned to point to another string, the statement
    s = "goodbye"
will result in a compile-time error and the ide will give you "the final ... can not
be reassigned"
