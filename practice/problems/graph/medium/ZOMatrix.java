 * > PROBLEM 542 (medium): Zero-One Matrix
 *   Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.
 *   The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.
 * 
 *   - the returning matrix has the following meaning: 
 *       result[i][j] = k -> the nearest 0 to the element in mat[i][j] is at distance k
 * 
 * > SOLUTION:
 *   // TODO
