-- REMINDER ON STRINGS INIZIALIZATION --
> duh: in Java a string is an object that represents a sequence of characters
  or char values. The java.lang.String class is used to create a Java String object

- TWO WAYS TO CREATE A STRING OBJECT

1) BY STRING LITERAL: java string literal is creaded by using double quotes. 
    - String s = "hello";
2) BY new KEYWORD: java String is created by using the keyword "new"
    - String s = new String("hello");
   Using "new" are created two objects (one in the String Pool and one in the Heap), 
   plus one reference where the variable will refer to the object in the heap.

> JAVA STRING POOL
The java string pool refer to collection of strings which are stored in heap memory. 
In this, whenever a new object is created the JVM checks in the String pool whether
the object is already present in the pool or not. 
If it is present then same reference is returned to the variable. 
    - example: 
        String s = "hello";
        String s2 = "hello";
        System.out.println(s == s2); // true: s2 points to s!
If it is not present a new objct is actually allocated and the reference is returned.
