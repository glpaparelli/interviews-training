 *   Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest commong ancestor (LCA) node 
 *   of two given nodes in the BST. 
 * 
 *   Def of LCA: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as
 *   the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow 
 *   a node to be a descendant of itself)."
